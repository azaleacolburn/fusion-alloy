# fusion-alloy

Plugin package manager for Autodesk Fusion (formerly Fusion 360)

## Structure

- An alloy is a plugin, it is a list of compositions which are differences between versions. This is just a git repo. Commits can be assigned names and / or versions by the creator or user
- The Compositions dir in every device contains all the compositions, theses can be used to download and verify alloys
- Once an alloy is installed, it's stored in the Furnace

## Dry keyword list

- post plugin (verb)
- where all alloys are stored (noun)
- where a series of versions are stored (noun)
- a single version of a plugin (noun)
- compress a single version and or condence a list of versions into a single version (verb: compress)

## Keyword brainstorming

- Cast (verb)
- Smelt (verb)
- Cavitated (adj)
- Crucible (noun)
- Decant (verb, pour)
- Furnace (noun)

- Furnaces heat and contain crucibles (were the versions are stored, this may or may not be the fusion install location)
- Crucibles contain alloys
- Alloys of the same metals might have different ratios (might do versioning with this analogy)
